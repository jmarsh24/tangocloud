  description: "The Golden Age of Radio, also known as the old-time radio (OTR) era, was an era of radio programming in the United States during which radio was the dominant electronic home entertainment medium. It began with the birth of commercial radio broadcasting in the early 1920s and lasted through the 1950s, when television gradually superseded radio as the medium of choice for scripted programming and dramatic entertainment."
